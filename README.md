# code-challenge-1

A quick project using jQuery (and a little Bootstrap on the side for practice--hope that's okay) to see where we are coding-wise.

Click the generate button to generate a new div with a number indicating how many times you've performed that operation. Each generated div should be red and have two buttons: _swap_ and _delete_.

If you click the _swap_ button, it should change switch the div between red and yellow. The _delete_ button should delete the div, without impacting the numbering.

Give it a try!
